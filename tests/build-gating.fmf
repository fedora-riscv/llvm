#
# Build/PR gating tests for *LLVM 13*
#
# Compatible with various LLVM 13 distributions:
#
#   * Fedora (ursine packages)
#   * Centos 9 stream (ursine packages)
#   * RHEL-9 (ursine packages)
#   * RHEL-8 (Red Hat module)
#   * RHEL-7 (software collection)

summary: LLVM tests for build/PR gating
adjust:
  - because: "Plan to be ran when either executed locally, or executed by CI system to gate a build or PR."
    when: >-
      trigger is defined
      and trigger != commit
      and trigger != build
    enabled: false

  - because: "When testing SCL-ized LLVM, the collection must be enabled first"
    environment+:
      WITH_SCL: "scl enable llvm-toolset-13.0 rust-toolset-1.58"
    when: "collection == llvm-toolset-13.0"

  # Unfortunatelly, TMT does not support more declarative approach, we need to run commands on our own.
  - because: "On RHEL, CRB must be enabled to provide rarer packages"
    prepare+:
      - name: Enable CRB
        how: shell
        script: dnf config-manager --set-enabled rhel-CRB
    when: >-
      distro == centos
      or distro == rhel-9
      or distro == rhel-8

  # Unfortunatelly, TMT does not support more declarative approach, we need to run commands on our own.
  - because: "On RHEL-7, EPEL must be enabled to provided rarer packages"
    prepare+:
      - name: Enable EPEL
        how: shell
        script: |
          rpm -q epel-release || yum install -y https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
