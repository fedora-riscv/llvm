  # Common requirements when LLVM is not SCL-ized
  - require+:
    # Required for rust and possibly other dependant packages
    #
    # NOTE #1: drop the requirement once the transitional period between releases is gone
    # and llvm-compat is no longer a) needed, and b) part of the build.
    #
    # NOTE #2: keep it the first requirement. Depending on the order of requirements, placing it somewhere
    # else in the list may lead to harness uninstalling and re-installing LLVM packages. That a) would be
    # a waste of time, b) could potentially hide issues, leading to testing unexpected NVRs.
